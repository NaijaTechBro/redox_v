<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I've chosen to remain anonymous for safety and privacy reasons and for some that knows me kindly do keep it that way.</p>

<p>Here are some details about me that I can share.</p>

<div className="about-me">
<ul>â€¢ I reached financial independence before getting into Cryptocurrency.</ul> <p>I did this by building an e-learning platform for over a decade and creatijng online content, which is still running. I've been into the FIRE movement early on (Financial independence, retire early). I've always lived a frugal life and now i am investing in index funds.</p>

<ul>â€¢ I've been in Cryptocurrency since 2016. I lost all my Crypto in the Investment ( Ponzi Scheme ) Era.</ul> <p> Built a 7 figure portfolio and saw it crash -90% with Crypto winter.</p>

<ul>â€¢ I entered Crypto again in late 2020.</ul><p> I built a large portfolio through early investments in BNB, Cake, Luna, and others.</p>

<ul></ul> <p>(And by taking profits aggressively) lost some due to corona and then started taking trading crypto more intense.</p>

<ul></ul> <p>It's because of this that I'm interested in being on the edge of Crypto and Finance.</p>
